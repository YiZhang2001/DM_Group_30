# Welcome to the repository of DM_Group_30

In this repository, we are going to do data validation, database update and advanced data analysis for our synthetic e-commerce data.

The Rscripts 'R/Data_Validation_and_Update_Database.R' and 'Data_Analysis.R' are used to realize our goals.

We automated the workflow to automatically run Rscripts and add outcomes files to git staging area.

So when new data comes, we don't need to do anything. The github action will run the workflow to generate the outcome files for us\~
